## üö® COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Missing Translation Keys
**Solution**: Add keys to en.json before translating page

### Issue 2: Complex Interpolation
**Solution**: Use {{variable}} syntax, test with different values

### Issue 3: Nested Components
**Solution**: Pass t function as prop or use useTranslation in child

### Issue 4: Dynamic Content
