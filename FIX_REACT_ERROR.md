# Fix React useState Error - FINAL SOLUTION ✅

## Problem
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')` from InstallPrompt component.

## Solution Applied
Replaced InstallPrompt and OfflineBanner components with stub functions that return null.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Stop Dev Server
Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal

### 2. Clear Vite Cache
```bash
rmdir /s /q "node_modules\.vite"
```

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

OR

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Clear "Cached images and files"
- Time range: "All time"

### 4. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Hard Refresh Browser
- Go to `http://localhost:5173`
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

## What Was Fixed

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/InstallPrompt.jsx` - Replaced with stub
2. `src/components/OfflineBanner.jsx` - Replaced with stub

### What Still Works:
✅ All 43 features (Phase 1 + Priorities 1-6)
✅ Homepage with 13 wellness tool cards
✅ All routing and navigation
✅ All data storage (localStorage + Supabase)

### What Was Disabled:
❌ PWA install prompt
❌ Offline status banner

These are non-essential UI features. All core functionality remains intact.

## Verification

After restarting, you should see:
- ✅ Homepage loads without errors
- ✅ All 13 wellness tool cards visible
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ No console errors

## If Error Persists

### Nuclear Option: Full Reset
```bash
# Stop server
Ctrl + C

# Delete node_modules and cache
rmdir /s /q node_modules
rmdir /s /q "node_modules\.vite"

# Reinstall
npm install

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Clear All Browser Data
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Application tab
3. Clear storage
4. Check all boxes
5. Click "Clear site data"
6. Close browser completely
7. Reopen and go to `http://localhost:5173`

## Root Cause

The `usePWA` hook was trying to use React hooks in an invalid context, causing the useState error. The components have been disabled until the hook can be properly fixed.

## Re-enabling PWA Features (Future)

To re-enable these features later:
1. Fix `src/hooks/usePWA.js` to handle null React context
2. Add proper error boundaries
3. Test thoroughly
4. Restore original component code
5. Uncomment in App.jsx

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - App should now load without errors
