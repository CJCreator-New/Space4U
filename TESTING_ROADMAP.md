## 🆘 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

1. **Test Timeouts**
   - Mitigation: Use fireEvent instead of userEvent
   - Backup: Increase timeout thresholds

2. **Mock Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Centralize mocks in setup.js
   - Backup: Create mock utilities

3. **Coverage Plateaus**
   - Mitigation: Focus on high-value paths
   - Backup: Accept 75% as sufficient

4. **Time Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical paths
   - Backup: Extend timeline if needed
