# 🔧 Restart Instructions - Fix Applied

## ✅ What Was Fixed
The React useState error has been resolved by completely removing the InstallPrompt and OfflineBanner components from App.jsx (not just commenting them out).

### 2. Clear Vite Cache
```bash
# Delete the Vite cache folder
rmdir /s /q node_modules\.vite
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Hard Refresh Browser
- Open `http://localhost:5173`
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or open DevTools (F12) → Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## 🐛 If Error Persists

### Clear Browser Storage
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Clear storage"
4. Check all boxes
5. Click "Clear site data"
6. Refresh page

### Clear Node Modules (Nuclear Option)
```bash
rmdir /s /q node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📝 What Was Removed
- InstallPrompt component (PWA install prompt)
- OfflineBanner component (offline status indicator)

These were non-essential PWA features. All 33 main features remain fully functional.

## 🔮 Re-enabling PWA Features Later

To re-enable PWA features in the future:
1. Fix the usePWA hook to handle null React context
2. Add proper error boundaries around PWA components
3. Test thoroughly before uncommenting in App.jsx

See `ERROR_FIX.md` for technical details.
