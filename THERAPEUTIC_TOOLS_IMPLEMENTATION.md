- Proper indexes for performance
- JSONB fields for flexible data structures

**API Endpoints**: `backend/server.js`
```
GET  /api/thought-records
POST /api/thought-records
GET  /api/dbt-skills
POST /api/dbt-skills
GET  /api/mindfulness-sessions
POST /api/mindfulness-sessions
GET  /api/sleep-logs
POST /api/sleep-logs (upsert)
GET  /api/crisis-plan

```

### Frontend (React)

**Main Page**: `src/pages/TherapeuticToolsPage.jsx`
- Tool selection grid
- Icon-based navigation
- Responsive layout

**Components**: `src/components/therapeutic/`
- `CBTThoughtRecord.jsx` - Multi-step thought record form
- `DBTSkillsModule.jsx` - DBT skills practice logger
- `MindfulnessExercises.jsx` - Meditation timer and tracker
- `SleepHygieneTracker.jsx` - Sleep log with duration calculator
- `CrisisSafetyPlan.jsx` - Comprehensive safety planning
- `MentalHealthAssessments.jsx` - PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening

**Routing**: Added `/tools` route in `App.jsx`

**Navigation**: Added "Tools" link with Activity icon in `Navigation.jsx`

## Data Flow

### Guest Users (Not Logged In)
1. All data stored in localStorage
2. Keys prefixed with `safespace_`
3. JSON serialization for complex data
4. No server communication

### Authenticated Users
1. Data saved to Supabase via API
2. JWT token authentication
3. Row Level Security enforces user isolation
4. Real-time sync capability (future enhancement)

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Tools
1. Navigate to "Tools" in bottom navigation (mobile) or sidebar (desktop)
2. Select desired therapeutic tool from grid
3. Complete tool-specific workflow
4. Save data (automatically stored)

### Best Practices
- **CBT Thought Record**: Use when experiencing distressing thoughts
- **DBT Skills**: Log immediately after practicing a skill
- **Mindfulness**: Practice daily for best results
- **Sleep Tracker**: Log every morning upon waking
- **Crisis Plan**: Create proactively, review regularly
- **Assessments**: Take every 2 weeks to track progress

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All user data isolated via RLS policies
- No cross-user data access
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Encrypted at rest (Supabase)

### Privacy Considerations
- Crisis plans contain sensitive contact information

- Thought records may contain personal information
- All data remains private to user

### Disclaimers
- Tools are for self-help, not diagnosis
- Professional consultation recommended
- Crisis situations require immediate professional help
- Assessments are screening tools, not diagnostic
