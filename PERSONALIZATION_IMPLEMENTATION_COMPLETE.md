## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Initialization
```javascript
// Automatically initializes on first use
initPersonalization()
```

### 2. Usage Tracking
```javascript
// Track when user uses a feature
trackFeatureUsage('gratitude', 120) // 120 seconds
trackTimePattern('gratitude') // Records time-of-day
```

### 3. Adaptive Dashboard
- Shows top 6 most relevant tools
- Prioritizes based on:
  - Recent usage (last 24 hours = +100 score)
  - Usage frequency (count × 0.7)
  - Time-of-day patterns
  - Mood state

### 4. Recommendations
- Goal-based (from onboarding)
- Mood-based (anxiety → breathing exercises)
- Engagement-based (similar features)
- Priority levels: urgent, high, medium, low

### 5. Privacy
- All data in localStorage
- No external transmission
- Complete user control
- Transparent processing

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Enable Personalization
```javascript
// Already enabled by default
// Check status:
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('safespace_personalization'))
```

### Test Adaptive Dashboard
1. Go to HomePage
2. See "Personalized for you" badge
3. View "Your Top Tools" section
4. See recommendations (if any)

### Test Usage Tracking
```javascript
// In browser console:
import { trackFeatureUsage } from './src/utils/usageTracker.js'
trackFeatureUsage('gratitude', 120)
trackFeatureUsage('habits', 60)
trackFeatureUsage('mood-tracker', 30)
// Reload page to see updated dashboard
```

### Test Recommendations
```javascript
// Set goals in user profile:
const profile = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('safespace_user_profile') || '{}')
profile.goals = ['anxiety', 'depression']
localStorage.setItem('safespace_user_profile', JSON.stringify(profile))
location.reload()
// See anxiety/depression-related recommendations
```

### Test Settings
1. Go to `/personalization`
2. Toggle personalization ON/OFF
3. Change preferences (dashboard layout, recommendation frequency, help level)
4. Reset personalization
5. See privacy guarantees
