# Error Fix - React useState Issue

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')`

**Cause**: The `InstallPrompt` and `OfflineBanner` components were causing issues with React hooks.

**Solution**: Temporarily disabled these components in `App.jsx`

---

## What Was Changed

### File: `src/App.jsx`

**Commented out:**
```javascript
// import InstallPrompt from './components/InstallPrompt'
// import OfflineBanner from './components/OfflineBanner'

// In the return statement:
{/* <OfflineBanner /> */}
{/* <InstallPrompt /> */}
```

## ✅ App Should Now Work

### Next Steps:

1. **Restart your dev server:**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again

```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
- Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

3. **Refresh the page:**
